# Version 1.0.0 - Base Model with Web Interface Integration

## Key Features

- **Separate Training/Validation Structure**: Implemented distinct directories for training and validation datasets
- **Web Interface for Camera Streaming**: Added web application for real-time fire detection via camera
- **Enhanced Visualizations**:
  - Grouped bar plots showing distribution across both training and validation sets
  - Sample image grid from training data
  - Training history with accuracy and loss curves
  - Confusion matrix for model evaluation

## Directory Structure Changes
```
data/
├── train/          # Training data (previously was root level)
│   ├── fire/
│   └── no_fire/
└── validation/     # New validation split (previously handled by ImageDataGenerator)
    ├── fire/
    └── no_fire/
```

## Technical Improvements

- Removed automatic validation split from ImageDataGenerator in favor of explicit validation directory
- Added web interface with camera streaming capabilities for real-time detection
- Added error handling for missing directories and empty datasets
- Implemented non-interactive matplotlib backend support for headless environments
- Added statistics printing for both training and validation sets

## Known Limitations

- Small initial dataset size
- Basic data augmentation parameters
- Single GPU training only
- No distributed training support

## Current State

- Model is trained and validated on the provided dataset
- Web interface implemented for camera-based detection
- Visualizations are functional but could be improved
- Dataset size is small, limiting potential for advanced model performance
- Will be creating a new branch for expanded dataset training

## Next Steps

- Create branch for expanded dataset training
- Create branch for Raspberry Pi testing
- Create branch for blynk integration
